# Blood Analysis
This program analyzes patient cholesterol data for HDL and LDL levels, returning whether the test results are normal, high, low, or somewhere in between. 

The main interface looks as follows:
```Cholesterol Calculator
   Options:
   1 - Cholesterol Analysis
   2 - Enter Patient Data
   9 - Quit
   Enter your option:
   ```

Option 1 allows the user to enter HDL or LDL cholestorol test results in the form `HDL: x, x, x`. These results are then analyzed depending on the test type to determine whether the levels are normal, high, low, or somewhere in between. 

Option 2 allows the user to input a new patient's information: First Name, Last Name, and Age. This information is saved in a JSON file.
